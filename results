Here are the results of the FuturePricePrediction algorithm on some liquid stocks/futures.
I made a comparative analysis of the FuturePricePrediction algorithm (FPP) with two trading strategies: 
naive (Buy&Hold) and more complex (creating forecast using ARIMA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average)

Trade period = 200 days. Quantity per trade = 1

ARIMA     |   254,11
