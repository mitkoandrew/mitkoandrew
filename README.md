Nice to meet you here!

# About Me

My name is Andrew. I am a Software Engineer (.NET), also write on Python.

My Linkedn:

My CV: https://my.indeed.com/p/andreym-7jqchaq

I am currently open to cooperation proposals as a Programmer.

The spheres of my constant interests and research are Programming and the Stock Market.

I am a mathematician by basic education, started my career with the development of Forecasting systems. 
Then I worked in a brokerage company, where I learned a lot about financial markets and support for trading operations.

A few years ago I started working as a Software Engineer. 
At the same time (in my free time) I started my own project, which called FuturesPricePrediction. 

# About project

The entire project helps the client make a decision about operations in the stock market: Buy / Sell or do nothing with the selected stock or futures. 
It includes three parts:

-Forecast algorythm

-Analysis part ([FuturesForecastAnalysis](https://github.com/mitkoandrew/FuturesForecastAnalysis))

-Trading system (interacts with MetaTrader)

The first two parts were implemented in .NET, the third part - in Python.
